                          <h4>Counseling for anxiety</h4>
                          <p>Is anxiety taking over your life? <br>

                            Does it feel like you can’t control it no matter how hard you try? <br>
                            
                            Have you already tried therapy, but found it ineffective?<br>
                            
                            If this sounds like you, I’m confident I can help. My practice offers the most effective forms of treatment to get the relief from anxiety that you deserve.<br>
                            
                            When it comes to treating anxiety disorders, research shows that therapy is usually the most effective option. That’s because therapy for anxiety — as opposed to taking anxiety medication — treats more than just symptoms to the problem.<br>

                          <h4>EMDR</h4>
                          <p>I am an EMDR-trained therapist (Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing) and frequently use this technique when working with clients who are suffering from trauma, anxiety, panic, disturbing memories, post traumatic stress, and other emotional problems. In the past, these conditions were difficult and time-consuming to treat. EMDR therapy often has been found to help the client heal more rapidly and provide lasting relief for many types of emotional distress.

                            <br>After using EMDR in one or more sessions, clients report feeling as if a heavy burden has been lifted from their shoulders. Many people have been held back for years by unresolved issues that have kept them from enjoying their current life. EMDR has demonstrated dramatic and lasting results and is backed by research, as well as by individuals who have experienced the results.

                          <h4>Individual Therapy</h4>
                          <p>Are you having a difficult time handling the struggles in your life?<br>

                            Could you use an expert opinion on what you’re going through, or a non-judgmental ear just to listen?<br>
                            
                            Are you hesitant to talk to others about your problems?<br>
                            
                            If you answered “yes” to any of these questions, then individual therapy could be the solution you’ve been seeking. Individual therapy differs from group or alternative therapy methods in the way that you are the sole focus of a single therapist who helps you develop and achieve your goals for therapy.<br>
                            
                            If you’ve been feeling hopeless or lost lately, or struggling with a problem in your life that feels unsurmountable, individual therapy could help you improve your everyday life. Individual therapy helps you win whatever you’re battling by putting a real expert in your corner by means of a professional therapist.</p>

                          <h4>Life Transitions</h4>
                          <p>“The only thing constant is change.”

                            ~ Heraclitus, Greek philosopher<br>
                            
                            Has your life been touched by a major event such as a death, divorce, or layoffs at work? <br>
                            
                            Are you having a hard time moving through and past the emotional turmoil? <br>
                            
                            Do you feel completely stuck and like you need guidance getting back on track?<br>
                            
                            There’s no denying that life often presents us with our fair share of challenges, usually in the form of sudden change. These life transitions, even the positive ones, can throw us into a tailspin and leave us feeling stressed, confused, and vulnerable. But with the right tools and mindset, you have the power to not only overcome any adversity, but also transform into a more authentic and confident version of yourself.

                          <h4>PTSD</h4>
                          <p>Have you experienced a traumatic event? <br>

                            Are you suffering from lingering fear and anxiety? <br>
                            
                            Do you feel like you no longer have any control over how you think, feel, and behave?<br>
                            
                            Posttraumatic stress disorder — also known as PTSD — is a mental health challenge that may occur in individuals who have experienced or witnessed a traumatic event such as a natural disaster, a terrorist act, an act of war, a serious accident, rape, or any other violent personal assault.<br>
                            
                            It is believed that PTSD affects nearly four percent of the U.S. adult population. While it is usually linked with veterans who have experienced combat, PTSD occurs in all people regardless of age, race, nationality, or culture. In fact, women are twice as likely to experience PTSD than men.

                            Are you a busy stay-at-home or working parent, and don’t have the time to drive across town for an appointment?<br>
                            
                            Do you live in a more rural area, or maybe you prefer to just do things virtually?<br>
                            
                            If so, I can help you, through virtual therapy.<br>
                            
                            Telehealth allows us to provide counseling and therapy to our clients via live video conferencing. This can be done anywhere you have a computer or smartphone.<br>
                            
                            Telehealth appointments can be very beneficial if getting to a traditional in-person appointment is not convenient, or you simply just don’t want to.<br>
                            
                            My telehealth solution allows you to schedule an appointment and have the entire therapy session take place digitally. While you don’t need a video camera, I do recommend you use one. To learn more and get started with virtual therapy, please contact me today.

                          <h4>Therapy for Depression</h4>
                          <p>Are you feeling hopeless, isolated, and not your usual self?<br>

                            Do these thoughts often enter your mind?<br>
                            
                            I am worthless and can’t do anything about it.<br>
                            I feel guilty for just wanting to eat, sleep, and be alone.<br>
                            I hate who I am these days.<br>
                            I can’t stop crying, which makes me want to stay away from others.<br>
                            I feel gut-wrenching pain, but no one understands.<br>
                            My life and the world around me are dark. I hate it, but I can’t change it.<br>
                            If you have had any variation of these thoughts and don’t feel like your usual self, chances are you may be suffering from depression.<br>
                            
                            I want you to know that you are not alone and there are people who can help. Many of my clients find relief in realizing that their struggle does not own them and that there are many options available for them to once again have hope for their lives.<br>
                            
                            I understand the social stigmas that come with the label of being depressed, and thus aim to help clients sort out their environmental, biological, and circumstantial factors while offering support and care through a very dark time in their lives.<br>
                            
                            If you are hoping to finally lighten this load and feel like yourself again, contact me today for a free consultation.

                          <h4>Brainspotting</h4>
                          <p>Brainspotting is a relatively new form of treatment that taps into the body’s​ innate ability to heal in order to reduce and eliminate the impact of unresolved trauma, negative beliefs, and emotional distress. It accomplishes this by using a unique and powerful combination of specific eye positioning and bilateral auditory stimulation (music).<br>

                            Developed by Dr. David Grand just over a decade ago, brainspotting is based upon the idea that what’s going on inside our brain is directly related to where we focus our eyes. To quote Dr. Grand, “Where you look affects how you feel.” That’s the foundational premise — the motto — of this powerful modality.<br>
                            
                            Dr. Grand discovered that there is a very specific and intimate relationship between our brain and our eyes. Whenever we visually scan our surroundings for information, we’re also scanning our brain for our thoughts, ideas, and emotional responses. We also may be scanning our brain to find where repressed memories and feelings (related to something traumatic or distressing) are stored.<br>
                            
                            Many experts in the area of trauma treatment believe that when we are overwhelmed by something traumatic or deeply distressing, the emotional “charge” or memory from that event becomes stored or trapped in our body. We’re often unaware that this has even occurred, but our brain is altered as a result. It can cause problems on all levels — emotionally, mentally, and physically.
